Sketchnotes are rich visual notes created from a mix of handwriting,
drawings, hand-drawn typography, shapes, and other visual elements.
Hartnett-Henderson is here talking about sketchnotes because she's one
person with multiple careers: her day job is a strategist, and she's
also an artist working in photography. Finding balance between the two
has been really difficult: either looking for a paying job while doing
art, or having a job and leaving the art aside. So sketchnotes have
been a way to bring her artistic life into her day job.

Sketchnotes work because they code information in both images and
words: by encoding in two different ways ("dual coding"), it's easier
for people to comprehend and absorb.

Sketchnotes aren't art, so don't worry if you've had a traumatic art
experience [ha ha]: they're images in service of information. You only
need to be able to draw simple geometric shapes to create sketchnotes.

Resources: Mike Rohde's "Sketchbook Handbook" (especially the video
edition) is useful for getting started. Eva-Lotta Lamm is paid to
attend conferences to sketch, and publishes her sketches annually.

Tools: Tools are a distraction, so pen and paper are great. Some apps
like Paper by FiftyThree are good, as well.
