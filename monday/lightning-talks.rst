A Plea to Open Source Maintainers
---------------------------------
:Author: Daniel Beck

Daniel is a technical writer, and he'd like more writers to contribute
to open source projects. He can program, but writing is what he does
best. And he's seen writers be rebuffed and rejected with things like

* The source is self-documenting [but the community expectations,
  prerequisites, etc, are not]
* That's being rewritten
* or just Silence

There's a lot of effort and energy being squandered or rejected, and
that's a problem. Daniel was a technical communication major, and did
a lot of project based coursework. Those projects were never around
open source projects, due to these experiences (and that's approx 100
hours of work that could have been applied).

What can you do?

* (Easy) Talk to a writer
* (Medium) Have a docs sprint
* (Advanced) Mentor a writer

Writing User Guides
-------------------

You can write better user guides by:

* Trying to understand the initial playing field of your user (what
  do they know, etc). Campaign monitor does this by linking failed
  help search terms to support emails. This lets the support team gain
  insight into their mindset.

The X.org Virtual Book Sprint
-----------------------------
:Author: Bart Massey

About two years ago they decided to try to address the issue of poor
documentation and small contributor base. Based on the idea of the
GSoC Book Sprint, but had to be virtual because of scheduling and
travel. Two days, effectively 3 people (had hoped for half a dozen?).
Used Gobby, Markdown, Sigil, and Inkscape, and wrote about 40 pages of
developer documentation.

Two people wasn't really enough: people should be committed to
participate for the entire time. It might also be interesting to try
and pair people locally, so virtual, with local pairs. And having the
tools tested and solidly in place and tested is important. Nothing
will happen post sprint.

FAQs: Stop the Cargo Cult
-------------------------
:Author: Eric Redmond

An FAQ is a bad code smell, a bad documentation smell. It's a sign
that the docs aren't put together well and don't actually answer the
questions. It's a sign of cargo-cult documentation. You're starting a
new project, so by definition there are no frequently asked questions,
but you've seen others do it, so you think it must be useful!

Also, there's an FAQ markup language: FML.
