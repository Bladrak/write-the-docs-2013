How do you continue loving what you're doing? Writing documentation
isn't always easy, but it's supposed to be worth. A career is like
marriage: it's supposed to require some work. You have to fill out an
application, you're supposed to think about it, and after a few years,
you start to think about things. And you get invested, so maybe you're
willing to tough it out a little. But the outlook for marriages -- and
jobs -- isn't all that rosy.

So what can we do to fall [back] in love with your gig?

#. Remember why you loved it in the first place.

   Maybe you really like the look of a blank document, the empty
   margins, the sense of possibility. Or the ability to change a
   document's meaning with punctuation only. Or the fact that most
   people don't know a colon from a semi colon from a comma.
#. You can try and refresh your outlook

   Looking at cute images
   increases fine motor skills; turning your desk away from the window
   (which makes you more productive); try using a different font just
   to see something different, sweat

#. Look at your docs through someone else's eyes.

   Maybe you just need a fresh perspective on why you do what you do.
   Talk to students, interns, users, or colleagues who are seeing the
   docs for the first time. Talk to someone else about your job
   (especially if they're a mortician or an accountant). And go back
   and look at your first work: see how you've grown and your work has
   developed.

And remember... If you can't be with the one you love, love the one
you're with.
