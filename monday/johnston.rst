So what does "concise" mean? Concise does not mean "short". *Concise*
means minimal: just as long as your readers need, and no longer. And
"minimal" does not mean "robospeak"; you don't say "push button", you
say "push the button". Minimal does not mean dropping articles.
Minimal doesn't mean content should be gutted for mobile. People read
everything on their mobile devices.

Minimal means enough to meet your audiences' needs, and enough to
accomplish your purposes. No more and no less. Conciseness makes more
business sense than ever: you're dealing with small screens,
translation costs, and readability matters. Readability is usability
for your documentation. Have empathy for your users: don't make them
read more than they have to.

How much can a word cost? You can almost always eliminate a "be" verb.

::

   "You may be needing a loan."

   "You may need a loan."

If you pay $0.25 per word and eliminate one word from 10,000 sentences
that are translated into 25 languages, that's about $62,500 in
translation cost savings.

Even if you're not translating, and no matter what screen size, dump
words you don't need.

Dump these words (unless you need them):

* weak *be* verbs (is, was, were, will be, have been, am, are)
* *-ly* words (and other vapid adverbs)
* *very*, *such*, and *so* (and other empty intensifiers)
* *not*, *no* (and other negative words
* *the fact that*
* *just*
* *begin to*, *start to*, *try to*, *tend to*, *in order to*
* *point in time*
* *in light of*, *in spite of*, *in terms of*: *of* tips you off to
  bloated language
* *proverbial*
* *different* (ie, "three different versions")
* *particular*
* *verbiage*

The fix for these sort of issues isn't always self evident. You have
to think. These are tip offs that should trigger thinking about what
will work for the reader.

You can't always fix product problems with concise documentation: if
you're having trouble saying it concisely, maybe the product or code
needs to be revisited.
