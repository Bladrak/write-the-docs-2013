Writer, not a programmer, fiction as well as copywriting. The OED
documents the entymology of the English language, but text-speak is
evolving beyond that. She looked up "orientated", which to her dismay
is *in* the OED, first introduced by Harper's magazine in 1857. So if
that's a word, and if the English language is evolving, are there any
rules that are inviolate? The language is *not* static, even if we
choose to correct grammar according to the Chicago Manual of Style.
